## Models

There are 3 models provided with FiberSight, developed for specific tissues:
1) PSR\_9
2) WGA\_21
3) HE_\30

These models were trained on randomly selected patches of images stained with the specific fluorochrome.

When selecting a specific model, these will be installed into the usual cellpose directory (usually in /home/user/.cellpose/models/...)
